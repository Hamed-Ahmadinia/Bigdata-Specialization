# Machine Learning for Descriptive Problems (2021-22)

Welcome to the **Machine Learning for Descriptive Problems (2021-22)** branch of my Big Data Specialization portfolio. This branch contains projects focused on descriptive analysis and text mining, showcasing my skills in applying machine learning techniques to extract insights and patterns from complex datasets.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Text Data Mining
- **Description:** Implemented techniques to mine information from text data using pairwise Jaccard similarities, MinHash, and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH).
- **Key Techniques:** Jaccard Similarity, MinHash, LSH.

### 2. IMDB Reviews Text Mining
- **Description:** Defined project topics and implemented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models for sentiment analysis on the IMDB reviews dataset.
- **Key Techniques:** RNN, Sentiment Analysis.

### 3. IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis
- **Description:** Performed sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Keras.
- **Key Techniques:** LSTM, Keras, Sentiment Analysis.

### 4. Model Tuning and Comparison
- **Description:** Tuned the presented models and compared their performance with other RNN models to understand improvements in results.
- **Key Techniques:** Model Tuning, RNN Comparison, Performance Evaluation.

## Repository Structure

- Each project has its own directory within this branch, containing the following:
  - **Code:** Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks implementing the project.
  - **Data:** Sample datasets or links to the datasets used (where applicable).
  - **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the methods and results.
