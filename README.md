# Visual Analytics Projects - 2020-2021

Welcome to the Visual Analytics branch of my Big Data Specialization portfolio. This repository contains projects completed during my coursework in visual analytics at Arcada University of Applied Sciences. These projects showcase various data visualization techniques and tools used to explore and present complex datasets effectively.

## Project Overview

### 1. Visual Data Science with R
- **Description:** Developed a personalized theme and applied various data visualization techniques.
- **Techniques Used:** Frequency plots, histograms, boxplots, density plots, scatter plots, marginal scatterplots, beeswarm plots, hexagonal binning, parallel coordinate plots, and dumbbell plots.

### 2. Web-Based Data Visualization with D3.js
- **Description:** Implemented interactive and animated visualizations using D3.js.
- **Techniques Used:** Bar charts, scatterplots, interactive charts, animated charts.

### 3. Geoviz and Maps with CARTO
- **Description:** Conducted geospatial analysis using CARTO, focusing on cluster point calculations and risk analysis.
- **Case Studies:**
  - Police station and crime analysis
  - Earthquake magnitude analysis

## Key Technologies
- **R:** For creating static and interactive visualizations.
- **D3.js:** For building web-based, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **CARTO:** For geospatial data visualization and analysis.
